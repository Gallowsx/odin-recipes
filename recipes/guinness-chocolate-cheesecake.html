        <h3>Directions</h3>
        </center>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch springform pan with butter.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Combine crushed cookies, butter, 2 tablespoons sugar, and cocoa in a small bowl; mix;
                 press into the bottom of the prepared springform pan.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Place cream cheese in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer set to low speed until smooth. While beating, 
                slowly add 1 cup sugar and then eggs, one at a time. Continue beating until smooth.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Combine chocolate chips and heavy cream in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave until chocolate is completely 
                melted, stirring every 30 seconds. Beat chocolate into cream cheese mixture. Add sour cream, salt, beer, and vanilla; 
                blend until smooth. Pour mixture over crust and place the pan into a large, deep baking dish. 
                Fill the dish with water to cover the bottom half of the springform pan.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Bake cheesecake in the water bath in the preheated oven for 45 minutes; turn oven off; 
                leave cheesecake in the oven with oven door slightly ajar another 45 minutes; 
                remove from oven. Run a knife along the edge of the cheesecake to loosen from pan. 
                Chill in refrigerator at least 4 hours.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Melt semisweet chocolate in a small bowl using the microwave. Make chocolate clovers by 
                dropping 3 small drops of melted chocolate close to one another on waxed paper. 
                Drag a toothpick from between two dots outward to make the stem; chill until hardened. 
                Arrange the chocolate clovers on top of the chilled cheesecake for decoration.</li>
            <br>
            <li><em>Enjoy!</em></li>
